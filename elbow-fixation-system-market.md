<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elbow Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Fixation</li><li>Internal Fixation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elbow fixation system market is primarily divided into two types: external fixation and internal fixation. External fixation involves stabilizing fractured bones using devices placed outside the body, providing support while allowing for some mobility. This method is often employed for complex fractures or in cases where internal fixation isn't viable. Internal fixation, on the other hand, entails surgically implanting devices like plates, screws, or rods within the body to directly stabilize the bone, promoting quicker healing and recovery.</p></p>
